Model Train Protocol (MTP)
=============================

The Model Train Protocol (MTP) is an open-source framework for creating and training custom Language Models on Databiomes. MTP provides a structured approach to defining all the data, patterns, and behaviors that your model will learn.

How It Works
------------

MTP uses a structured approach where you define your model's knowledge and behavior through organized components. The system then converts these definitions into training data that teaches your model to respond appropriately in your domain.
