System Architecture
====================

The MTP system is built on a hierarchical structure of four main components that work together to create comprehensive training protocols for language models.

Architecture Overview
---------------------

The four core components are:

1. **Tokens** - The fundamental building blocks
2. **TokenSets** - Combinations of tokens that define input patterns
3. **Instructions** - Training patterns that inform the model what to do
4. **Guardrails** - Safety mechanisms for bad user prompts

Component Hierarchy
-------------------

Tokens
~~~~~~

Tokens are the base building blocks of the MTP system. They represent words, symbols, concepts, or actions that the model will understand and use.

- **Basic Token**: Standard tokens for concepts, actions, or entities
- **UserToken**: Specialized tokens for user input
- **NumToken**: Tokens associated with numerical values

TokenSets
~~~~~~~~~

TokenSets group multiple Tokens together to define specific input patterns. They represent the structure of data that will be fed to the model.

- TokenSets are the basic building blocks of instructions
- They can contain any combination of token types
- Snippets are created on TokenSets to provide training examples

Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instructions define how the model should respond to different input patterns. There are two main types:

- **SimpleInstruction**: For scenarios where the model responds without user input
- **UserInstruction**: For scenarios where the model responds to user prompts

Guardrails
~~~~~~~~~~

Guardrails provide safety mechanisms for user interactions by defining what constitutes good vs. bad user prompts and how the model should respond to inappropriate inputs.

Data Flow
---------

1. **Token Creation**: Define the basic building blocks
2. **TokenSet Assembly**: Combine tokens into meaningful patterns
3. **Snippet Generation**: Create training examples from TokenSets
4. **Instruction Definition**: Specify how the model should respond to TokenSet patterns
5. **Guardrail Application**: Add safety mechanisms

Best Practices
--------------

- Start with a clear understanding of your model's purpose
- Define tokens that represent the core concepts in your domain
- Create TokenSets that capture meaningful input patterns
- Use instructions to teach the model appropriate responses
- Always include guardrails for user-facing applications
- Test your protocol with various examples before deployment
