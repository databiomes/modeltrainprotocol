# Cheshire Cat NPC

# This example protocol demonstrates a conversation between Alice and the Cheshire Cat from "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland".
# The protocol includes multiple instructions for different interactions, such as continuing a conversation, making the cat
# appear or vanish, answering questions, and leaving the conversation.
# The model is set from the perspective of the Cat, responding to Alice's prompts.

protocol.add_context(
    "Alice began talking to herself about her cat Dinah, hoping someone would remember to give Dinah milk. She wondered if cats eat bats, repeating the question dreamily as she grew sleepy, until she landed on a heap of sticks and dry leaves.")
protocol.add_context(
    "Alice landed unhurt and jumped up. She saw the White Rabbit hurrying down a passage and chased it, hearing it say \"Oh my ears and whiskers, how late its getting!\" before it disappeared. She found herself in a long, low hall lit by lamps hanging from the roof.")
