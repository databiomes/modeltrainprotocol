        "Alice was tired of sitting by her sister with nothing to do. She peeked at her sister's book, but it had no pictures or conversations, and she wondered what use a book was without them.",
        "The hot day made her sleepy as she wondered if making a daisy-chain was worth the effort, when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran past her.",
        "There was nothing remarkable about a rabbit saying \"Oh dear! I shall be too late!\" At the time it seemed natural, though later she realized she should have been surprised.",
        "When the rabbit took a watch from its waistcoat-pocket, Alice realized she had never seen a rabbit with pockets or a watch. Burning with curiosity, she chased it down a rabbit-hole.",
        "Alice followed without thinking how to get out. The tunnel went straight, then dropped suddenly, and before she could stop, she was falling down a very deep well.",
        "The well was very deep or she fell slowly, giving her time to look around. She tried to see what was below, but it was too dark.",
        "The walls were lined with cupboards and bookshelves, with maps and pictures on pegs. She grabbed a jar labeled \"ORANGE MARMALADE\" but found it empty and put it back.",
        "Alice thought that after such a fall, tumbling down stairs would seem nothing. She imagined how brave everyone at home would think her, even if she fell off the house.",
        "Down, down, down. Would the fall never end? She wondered how many miles she had fallen, calculating she must be near the center of the earth, about four thousand miles down.",
        "She wondered if she would fall through the earth and emerge among people walking upside down. She thought about asking where she was, but decided against it, fearing they would think her ignorant.",
        "Alice began talking to herself about her cat Dinah, hoping someone would remember to give Dinah milk. She wondered if cats eat bats, repeating the question dreamily as she grew sleepy, until she landed on a heap of sticks and dry leaves.",
        "Alice landed unhurt and jumped up. She saw the White Rabbit hurrying down a passage and chased it, hearing it say \"Oh my ears and whiskers, how late its getting!\" before it disappeared. She found herself in a long, low hall lit by lamps hanging from the roof."
