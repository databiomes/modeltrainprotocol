        "There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ‚Äú Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!‚Äù when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural; but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket or a watch to take out of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.")

        "Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her, and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything:then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves: here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled ‚ÄúORANGE MARMALADE‚Äù, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.")

    protocol.add_context(
        "Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? ‚ÄúI wonder how many miles Ive fallen by this time?‚Äù she said aloud. ‚ÄúI must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think‚Äî‚Äù (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) ‚Äú‚Äîyes, thats about the right distance‚Äîbut then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude Ive got to?‚Äù (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)")

        "Presently she began again. ‚ÄúI wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny itll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think‚Äî‚Äù (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didnt sound at all the right word) ‚Äú‚Äîbut I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Maam, is this New Zealand or Australia?‚Äù (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke‚Äîfancy curtseying as youre falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) ‚ÄúAnd what an ignorant little girl shell think me for asking! No, itll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.‚Äù")
    protocol.add_context(
        "Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. ‚ÄúDinahll miss me very much to-night, I should think!‚Äù (Dinah was the cat.) ‚ÄúI hope theyll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, Im afraid, but you might catch a bat, and thats very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?‚Äù And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, ‚ÄúDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?‚Äù and sometimes, ‚ÄúDo bats eat cats?‚Äù for, you see, as she couldnt answer either question, it didnt much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, ‚ÄúNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?‚Äù when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.")

        "Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \"Oh my ears and whiskers, how late its getting!\" She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.")
