Integration tests for Model Train Protocol.

This package contains integration tests that test the interaction between
multiple components and end-to-end workflows:

- test_protocol_workflow.py: End-to-end protocol creation and management
- test_file_operations.py: Save/load operations and file handling

These tests ensure that components work together correctly in realistic scenarios.
